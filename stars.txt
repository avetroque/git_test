Blinking far a away in the vast sky
A tiny dot 
You may not even be there anymore, in the present reality
As you only shows us a glimpse of your past
Due to the light years that separates us apart
Likewise, can you see us in the darkness of the universe?
A tiny rock floating away with 9 brothers
And several smaller sisters toddling along of course
But even if you can see us, what you are seeing is our younger version
Where we were extremely cold, and full of violent animals

Blinking far a away in the vast sky
A tiny dot 
You may not even be there anymore, in the present reality
As you only shows us a glimpse of your past
Due to the light years that separates us apart
Likewise, can you see us in the darkness of the universe?
A tiny rock floating away with 9 brothers
And several smaller sisters of course
